noticed something’s going news” jerked head back dursleys’ dark livingroom window “i heard flocks owls shooting stars well they’re completely stupid bound notice something shooting stars kent — i’ll bet dedalus diggle never much sense” “you can’t blame them” said dumbledore gently “we’ve precious little celebrate eleven years” “i know that” said professor mcgonagall irritably “but that’s reason lose heads people downright careless streets broad page 11 harry potter philosophers stone jk rowling daylight even dressed muggle clothes swapping rumors” threw sharp sideways glance dumbledore though hoping going tell something didn’t went “a fine thing would day youknowwho seems disappeared last muggles found us suppose really gone dumbledore” “it certainly seems so” said dumbledore “we much thankful would care lemon drop” “a what” “a lemon drop they’re kind muggle sweet i’m rather fond of” “no thank you” said professor mcgonagall coldly though didn’t think moment lemon drops “as say even youknowwho gone — ” “my dear professor surely sensible person like call name knowwho’ nonsense — eleven years trying persuade people call proper name voldemort” professor mcgonagall flinched dumbledore unsticking two lemon drops seemed notice “it gets confusing keep saying youknowwho’ never seen reason frightened saying voldemort’s name” “i know haven’t” said professor mcgonagall sounding half exasperated half admiring “but you’re different everyone knows you’re one know oh right voldemort frightened of” page 12 harry potter philosophers stone jk rowling “you flatter me” said dumbledore calmly “voldemort powers never have” “only you’re — well — noble use them” “it’s lucky it’s dark haven’t blushed much since madam pomfrey told liked new earmuffs” professor mcgonagall shot sharp look dumbledore said “the owls nothing next rumors flying around know everyone’s saying he’s disappeared finally stopped him” seemed professor mcgonagall reached point anxious discuss real reason waiting cold hard wall day neither cat woman fixed dumbledore piercing stare plain whatever “everyone” saying going believe dumbledore told true dumbledore however choosing another lemon drop answer “what they’re saying” pressed “is last night voldemort turned godric’s hollow went find potters rumor lily james potter — — they’re — dead” dumbledore bowed head professor mcgonagall gasped “lily james can’t believe didn’t want believe oh albus ” dumbledore reached patted shoulder “i know know ” said heavily page 13 harry potter philosophers stone jk rowling professor mcgonagall’s voice trembled went “that’s they’re saying tried kill potters’ son harry — couldn’t couldn’t kill little boy one knows they’re saying couldn’t kill harry potter voldemort’s power somehow broke — that’s he’s gone” dumbledore nodded glumly “it’s — it’s true” faltered professor mcgonagall “after he’s done people he’s killed couldn’t kill little boy it’s astounding things stop name heaven harry survive” “we guess” said dumbledore “we may never know” professor mcgonagall pulled lace handkerchief dabbed eyes beneath spectacles dumbledore gave great sniff took golden watch pocket examined odd watch twelve hands numbers instead little planets moving around edge must made sense dumbledore though put back pocket said “hagrid’s late suppose told i’d way” “yes” said professor mcgonagall “and don’t suppose you’re going tell you’re places” “i’ve come bring harry aunt uncle they’re family left now” “you don’t mean — can’t mean people live here” cried professor mcgonagall jumping page 14 harry potter philosophers stone jk rowling feet pointing number four “dumbledore — can’t i’ve watching day couldn’t find two people less like us they’ve got son — saw kicking mother way street screaming sweets harry potter come live here” “it’s best place him” said dumbledore firmly “his aunt uncle able explain everything he’s older i’ve written letter” “a letter” repeated professor mcgonagall faintly sitting back wall “really dumbledore think explain letter people never understand he’ll famous — legend — wouldn’t surprised today known harry potter day future — books written harry — every child world know name” “exactly” said dumbledore looking seriously top halfmoon glasses “it would enough turn boy’s head famous walk talk famous something won’t even remember can’t see much better he’ll growing away he’s ready take it” professor mcgonagall opened mouth changed mind swallowed said “yes — yes you’re right course boy getting dumbledore” eyed cloak suddenly though thought might hiding harry underneath “hagrid’s bringing him” “you think — wise — trust hagrid something important this” page 15 harry potter philosophers stone jk rowling “i would trust hagrid life” said dumbledore “i’m saying heart isn’t right place” said professor mcgonagall grudgingly “but can’t pretend he’s careless tend — that” low rumbling sound broken silence around grew steadily louder looked street sign

wild — long tangles bushy black hair beard hid face hands size trash lids feet leather boots like baby dolphins vast muscular arms holding bundle blankets “hagrid” said dumbledore sounding relieved “at last get motorcycle” “borrowed professor dumbledore sir” said giant climbing carefully motorcycle spoke “young sirius black lent i’ve got sir” “no problems there” “no sir — house almost destroyed

dumbledore” “even could wouldn’t scars come handy one left knee perfect map london underground well — give hagrid — we’d better get with” dumbledore took harry arms turned toward dursleys’ house “could — could say goodbye sir” asked hagrid bent great shaggy head harry gave must scratchy whiskery kiss suddenly hagrid let howl like wounded dog “shhh” hissed professor mcgonagall “you’ll wake muggles” “sssorry” sobbed hagrid taking large spotted handkerchief burying face “but cc can’t stand — lily an’ james dead — an’ poor little harry ter live muggles — ” “yes yes it’s sad get grip hagrid

difference hair simply grew way — place harry frying eggs time dudley arrived kitchen mother dudley looked lot like uncle vernon large pink face much neck small watery blue eyes thick blond hair lay smoothly thick fat head aunt petunia often said dudley looked like baby angel — harry often said dudley looked like pig wig harry put plates egg bacon table difficult wasn’t much room dudley meanwhile counting presents face fell “thirtysix” said looking mother father “that’s two less last year” “darling haven’t counted auntie marge’s present see it’s big one mommy daddy” “all right thirtyseven
